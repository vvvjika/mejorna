BC-3:
This could be achieved by entering the TestScene in Unity, click one
design in gallery and click Save in design view. Then the gallery image
background could be set a solid color, and the background color could
be set as
SnapshotBehaviour.Instance.Capture(Color.gray);

BS-3:
in design view, bead could hover over with halo effect, and the effect
could be edit in MejornaV2.1/Resources/Halo.prefab

-----------------------------------------

Note: Use Unity3d version 3.5 only.  Usage of version 4 will cause issues when opening in 3.5 again.

Viewing Unity3d Project:

1) Start Unity3d
2) File>Open Project
3) Open Project tab>Open Other
4) Select local folder for all project files and Open
5) Within Unity3d application Project Panel, go to folder Mejorna
6) Open latest scene "POC v2 20120615" by double clicking

Note: For initial open, Unity will ask you to import assets.  Proceed to import all.  It may take a while.  Please be patient.  

Also, within Unity Project panel, not all the files are used for this project.  I've not gotten to clean everything up.

Some of the substances in Unity3d appear better when viewed with Unity3d version 4 beta, or in Allegorithmic Substance Designer.  There appears to be a bug that reduces the optimal viewing of the Substance Designer files in Unity3d version 3.5.
